# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `spurgeon-rag-app`
   - **Description:** `PDF library organization and RAG application with OCR support for Spurgeon's works`
   - **Visibility:** Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spurgeon-rag-app.git

# Push your commits
git push -u origin master
```

### Alternative: If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/spurgeon-rag-app.git
git push -u origin master
```
