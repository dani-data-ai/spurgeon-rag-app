# SP-Library File Renaming Log

This document tracks the systematic renaming of files in the sp-library collection.

## Renaming Process

Each file is examined for title and author information (typically found in the first 5-7 pages). Files are renamed following the pattern: `FileName_Author` where Author is the first/main author listed.
